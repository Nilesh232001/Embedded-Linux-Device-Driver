      Say M to compile this driver as a loadable kernel module, or Y for built-in.
      
      This driver provides a character device interface to GPIO pins through
      a Platform Driver framework, with Device Tree support.
      
      The driver creates /dev/gpio_dev for user-space GPIO control.
      
      If in doubt, say N.

config GPIO_DEVICE_DRIVER_DEBUG
    bool "Enable debugging output"
    default n
    help
      Enable debug kernel logging for the GPIO driver.
      This will produce verbose kernel messages during operation.

config GPIO_DEVICE_DRIVER_IRQ
    bool "Enable IRQ support"
    default y
    help
      Enable interrupt handling for GPIO pins.
      Allows detection of GPIO state changes via interrupts.
